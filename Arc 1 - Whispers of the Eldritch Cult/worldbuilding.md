# Eldoria

## Magic

### Rarity of Magic

In Eldoria, the ability to wield magic is an incredibly rare gift. Approximately 1 in 1000 people are born with this gift, and they are referred to as mages. Mages have the innate ability to manipulate an arcane energy known as mana, allowing them to cast spells.

### Mana and Mages

- **Mana**: The common term for the arcane energy that mages manipulate. It is an intangible energy that permeates the world
- **Mana Generation**: A mage's mana pool slowly increases naturally over time. Frequent use of magic can accelerate this increase. A mage's innate talent determines the maximum rate at which their mana can grow.
- **Mana Pool**: A mage's internal store of mana. It is closely tied to their physical condition. Poor health can cause a mage's mana pool to temporarily or permanently decrease. It replenishes naturally over time, but can be replenished faster through meditation. It can also be replenished through outside sources of mana, such as mana potions.
- **Effects of Mana**: Mana, as an energy, causes effects when it interacts with the physical world, similar to radiation. It exerts a strain on a mage's body when they cast spells, and too much mana can begin to cause cellular damage. This is known as mana poisoning. Similar to radiation poisoning, a little bit of mana poisoning will heal over time, but too much can cause permanent damage or even death. 
  - Mages will also begin to mutate over time as they use more and more mana. This can range from minor mutations, such as a change in eye color, to major mutations, such as the growth of extra limbs. These mutations are permanent, and can be passed down to offspring.

### Spellcasting

Mages cast spells by manipulating their mana into various complex shapes, resulting in various magical effects. Spells can draw upon a mage's mana pool, the mana in the environment, or a combination of both. The choice affects casting time, power, and complexity.

- **Self-Drawn Spells**: Spells drawing on the mage's own mana are quick to cast but limited by the mage's mana pool.
- **Environment-Drawn Spells**: Spells using the mana from the surroundings are more powerful but require more time to cast. They are limited by the amount of mana in the environment.
- **Combined Spells**: Mixed spells draw on both the mage's mana pool and the environment. They are often the most powerful but also the most challenging to cast.

### Mana in the Environment

The mana in the environment is not evenly distributed, and is often concentrated in certain areas, based of natural formations, the presence of ley lines, and many other factors. In these areas, magical materials and creatures are more likely to be found, and spells that draw on the environment are more powerful. These areas are commonly referred to as nexuses, and are often the sites of magical institutions, the dens of magical creatures, or the remains of magical battles.

### Ancient History of Magic

The Great Continent was once home to a great civilization, perhaps even multiple ones, according to scholars. These ancient societies surpass the current human kingdoms in terms of advancement, and possessed an extraordinary mastery over magic. 

Scholars, upon studying the ruins and artifacts left by this civilization, deduced that their mages possessed far greater control over mana. Their artifacts were incredibly intricate, and the mages of today can only use the simplest of these artifacts. These artifacts also require vast amounts of mana to power, leading scholars to believe that the ambient mana in the environment was much higher in the past.

The laws of magic dictate that mana cannot be created or destroyed. So, scholars believe that the disappearance of this civilization is connected to the decrease in ambient mana in the environment. Little else is known about this civilization, as their remnants are so old that any records have long since decayed, and the artifacts that remain are so complex that deciphering them is a monumental task.

The reason behind their disappearance is also unknown, and is the cause of much speculation, debate and concern among the scholars.

## Locations

### Lornridge

#### Geography

Lornridge is nestled on the eastern coast of the Great Continent, within the Kingdom of Wychmoor, overlooking the Azure Sea. It is situated on a sloped hill, surrounded by imposing cliffs, causing it's inhabitants to build vertically. It is a coastal town with a reliance on the fishing industry. It is a crucial hub for maritime commerce in the local region.

#### Demographics

Lornridge has a population of approximately 40,000 residents. The population is a diverse blend of natives and travelers, who are attracted by the town's enigmatic aura. Over time, the Seekers of Ry'leh will become a significant presence, with up to 1000 members, and most of the town's population as sympathizers.

#### Culture and Life

The town of Lornridge boasts a culture and architectural style reminiscent of Victorian England, replete with cobblestone streets, the warm glow of gas lamps, and intricately adorned facades. Nestled within the embrace of steep cliffs, Lornridge has developed into a vertical and compact town, a maze of narrow streets, archways, tunnels, and hidden corners, both above and below ground. The town's history, originally a humble fishing village, is evident in its layers of construction, with each generation building atop and below the previous. A sense of mystery shrouds Lornridge, as stories circulate of clandestine tunnels and concealed passages, and a portion of the town is even hewn into the cliffside.

As the heartbeat of Lornridge, the fishing industry has deeply influenced its customs and traditions. Festivals and rituals dedicated to safe voyages and bountiful catches are an integral part of life. One such cherished event is the annual Blessing of the Nets, during which townsfolk gather at the harbor to offer prayers for fruitful hauls.

Lornridge pulses with a vibrant music scene, where folk songs and sea shanties take center stage. These melodious tales celebrate the lives of fishermen, the majesty of the sea, and the strength of the community. Local taverns often host musicians and storytellers, and special occasions are marked by townwide gatherings filled with the resonant notes of these melodies.

At the heart of Lornridge lies a bustling marketplace, a focal point for traders who converge from near and far to exchange their wares. This vibrant hub is encircled by towering structures, with the grand church looming in the distance. Here, the air is alive with the energetic cadence of haggling and bartering.

Another marketplace lies hidden below the surface, in several large chambers in the lower levels of the town. The tunnels that lead to it are concealed and guarded, and connections are required to enter. It is a black market, where goods restricted by the Church or the Kingdom are traded. 

#### Local Factions

Lornridge plays host to several influential factions, each shaping the town's character.

**The Church**: The Church wields considerable power in Lornridge, albeit with an uncompromising approach. While its followers are treated benevolently, the Church displays an utter lack of tolerance for differing beliefs or faiths. Lornridge maintains a modest contingent of Inquisitors, who, like their counterparts in major towns, are charged with ferreting out heresy through often ruthless methods. The town is dotted with several churches, the grandest among them being the Cathedral of St. Cuthbert. The Church also holds sway over the majority of educational institutions in Lornridge, and its teachings are widely embraced by the populace.

**The Scholarium Magnus**: The Scholarium Magnus boasts a modest presence in Lornridge, with close affiliations to the town's sole college, sponsored by the Kingdom of Wychmoor. An invitation to join the Scholarium Magnus is reserved for the most gifted students and is esteemed as a profound honor.

**The Kingdom**: Lornridge operates as an extension of the Kingdom, housing a limited garrison of soldiers assigned to uphold order and safeguard the town. Additionally, a small naval base near Lornridge serves as a vital supply hub. The town houses the usual apparatus of government, including the mayor's office and the tax collection agency, to manage local affairs.

## Factions

### Kingdom of Wychmoor

#### Geography
Nestled as the northernmost realm on the Great Continent, the Kingdom of Wychmoor boasts a captivating and diverse terrain. Rugged coastlines, lush forests, fertile plains, and imposing mountain ranges define its geography. Steep cliffs guard treacherous coastlines, shaping the kingdom's relationship with the sea.

#### The White Sovereign
At the helm of Wychmoor stands the enigmatic King Alaric Thorne, revered by many as the White Sovereign. His reputation extends beyond mere royalty, as he is also blessed with the gift of magic. The White Sovereign possesses healing magics, and wears a white-and-gold cloak as he heals the sick and wounded. He is also a competent ruler, bringing great prosperity to the Kingdom with his decrees, and is well-loved by his subjects.

Outwardly, King Alaric is a pious and conservative ruler. He holds steadfast to the Church, and the Church, in return, has lent unwavering support to his rule. This religious institution has backed his throne. However, the White Sovereign secretly yearns for an independent Kingdom, free from the clutches of the church. Privately, he believes that the kingdom can thrive without the oppressive religious hierarchy, as it's doctrines have stifled the kingdom's technological and magical progress. He is not against the religion itself, but believes that the Kingdom is overreliant on the Church and its doctrines are too restrictive. 

#### Military Power

Wychmoor's military, while substantial, has witnessed a decline over the years due to increased reliance on the Church's Paladins and Inquisitors for maintaining order. 

However, the Wychmoor Expeditionary Corps stands as an elite group dedicated to exploring the enigmatic Far North. Their mission is to uncover magical artifacts and mysterious creatures that could empower the kingdom and hopefully, one day, allow them to break free from the Church's grasp. The Corps has a high attrition rate due to the dangers of the untamed Far North, but those who survive are rewarded handsomely. 

The Kingdom also possesses a small group of mages, the Royal Magi, few compared to the mages of other powers, but they are highly skilled and powerful. A strategic resource, they are rarely deployed in combat, but can turn the tide of battle when they are. They are also used to train the Wychmoor Expeditionary Corps, and are often deployed alongside them. The Scholarium Magnus has a presence in the Kingdom, and the Kingdom offers great rewards to hopefully entice the elite mages of the Scholarium to stay, train their own mages, and hopefully join the Royal Magi.

#### Economy & Industry

The kingdom's economy thrives on a rich tapestry of industries. Although its coastline features treacherous cliffs, Wychmoor maintains a fishing industry, albeit on a smaller scale. The agriculture and trade sectors constitute the backbone of the economy, with vast herds of livestock providing sustenance and tradeable animal products. Scattered mines in the northern regions yield vital metals and minerals used for both military and construction purposes. A burgeoning textile industry utilizes abundant wool from local livestock and cotton from the southern reaches, contributing to the kingdom's wealth.

### Ecclesia of Divine Light

**Note**: While there are multiple religions in the Great Continent, the Ecclesiarchy is the most powerful and widespread, and so many people simply refer to it as The Church.

#### Core Beliefs

- **Worship of the Divine Light**: The central tenet of the Church is the worship of the Divine Light. The Divine Light is seen as the source of all magic and the benevolent power that guides and protects humanity.
- **Monotheistic Faith**: The Church is monotheistic, with the belief in a single, all-powerful deity responsible for creating the world and its magic. The Divine Light is often depicted as a radiant sun or an ethereal, radiant, featureless figure.
- **Gift of Magic**: The Church teaches that magic is a divine gift for humanity to use. Those that possess it, the mages, have been chosen by the Divine Light to wield its power responsibly. 

#### Organizational Structure

- **High Council**: At the top of the Church hierarchy is the High Council, composed of the highest-ranking clergy members and led by the High Pontiff, who is considered the highest authority in matters of faith and doctrine.
- **Cardinals and Bishops**: Below the High Council are Cardinals and Bishops who oversee the administration of dioceses and regions. They are responsible for ensuring that the teachings of the Church are upheld in their respective areas.
- **Inquisitors**: Inquisitors are the Church's internal military enforcers, tasked with maintaining doctrinal purity and rooting out heresy. They are known for their ruthless methods and are feared by many. 
- **Paladins**: Paladins are the Church's external military warriors, tasked with protecting the Church and its followers from external threats. They are known for their skill in combat and their ability to wield magic. They are often deployed to protect important Church figures, such as Cardinals and Bishops, and to expand the Church's influence in the world.

**Note**: Considering the Church's attitude regarding magic, many of the Church's leaders are mages themselves. The High Pontiff is always a mage, and the Cardinals and Bishops are often mages as well. The Inquisitors and Paladins are also mages, but they are not as powerful as the Cardinals and Bishops.
