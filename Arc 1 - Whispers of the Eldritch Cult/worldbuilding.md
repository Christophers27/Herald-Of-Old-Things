### Lydia Anderton

**Background**: Lydia Anderton grew up in Lornridge, surrounded by books and a household dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge. Her parents were scholars of the Wychmoor College, and their home was always filled with the scent of old parchment. As a child, Lydia spent countless hours exploring the shelves of her family's extensive library, and this love for rare books and manuscripts eventually led her to become the town's librarian. 

**Motivation**: Lydia is motivated by a burning desire to uncover the secrets of the world. Despite not possessing magical abilities herself, she is fascinated by the arcane arts and believes that knowledge is the true source of power. 

Additionally, Lydia's parents had always dreamed of one day joining the Scholarium Magnus, and she inherited this dream. She hoped to one day become a member of this prestigious organization, but her lack of magical talent made this impossible. Deep down, she hopes that her study of the eldritch will grant her the ability to wield magic and fulfill her parents' dream. She is also spurred on by their old age, and wishes to do this before they pass away.

**Strengths**: Her strong attention to detail, research skills, extensive knowledge of arcane and obscure literature, and her problem-solving skills.

**Weakness**: Her unquenchable curiousity and desire for magic can lead her to take risks. She also has a lack of self-confidence stemming from her inability to wield magic, despite that being the norm for people.

### Eleanor "Ellie" Ravenscroft

**Background**: Ellie Ravenscroft comes from a long line of herbalists and botanists, tending to the town's medicinal needs for generations. She had a particular talent and fascination for nature, and spent much of her childhood exploring the forests and fields. She took to the family trade easily, and became a skilled herbalist.

**Motivation**: She is fascinated by the natural world and believes that what people had only begun scratching the surface of what it has to offer. She yearns to understand the secrets of nature, the magical properties of plants, and how they may interact with the eldritch.

Ellie's quiet nature masks a deep curiosity about the unknown. She believes that hidden within the eldritch flora are untapped secrets waiting to be discovered. Her inquisitiveness is driven by a desire to unlock the potential of these plants.

**Strength**: Ellie's expertise in botany and alchemy makes her the group's primary alchemist. She can create elixirs and potions with various effects. Her calm demeanor also helps maintain stability within the group.

**Weakness**: Her reserved personality can sometimes lead to difficulties in expressing her thoughts or feelings. Additionally, her intense focus on her work may cause her to overlook interpersonal dynamics.

### Gregor Thorne

**Background**: Gregor Thorne has spent most of his life as a fisherman, braving the unpredictable sea to provide for his family. He inherited his trade from his father and has heard countless tales of strange sea creatures from fellow sailors. 

**Motivation**: Gregor truly believes in the sailor's tales and is annoyed by people who doubt him. He is eager to prove the existence of these creatures and to uncover the mysteries of the sea. He is also motivated by a desire to provide for his family and to ensure their safety.

**Strength**: Gregor's expertise in navigation and his resilience at sea make him the group's leader for sea expeditions. His straightforward and honest nature makes people trust him easily.

**Weakness**: His stubbornness about the sailor's tales can lead to conflicts with others. His straightforwardness can also lead to him being tactless at times.
