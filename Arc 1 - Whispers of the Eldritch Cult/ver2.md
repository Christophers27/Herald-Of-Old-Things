## Chapter 1: Awakening

### Story

In the eerie stillness of a fog-covered dawn, Daniel awoke to a new world, strange, yet familiar. Cobblestone streets and Victorian brick buildings surrounded him, shrouded in an otherworldly half-light. An alien feeling permeated his body, the vast sum of eldritch knowledge entrenched in his mind slowly transforming his body, turning his very being to a more suitable container. 

He marveled at his transformation, his flesh becoming like wax, or clay, as he explored his new power, a new tool to fulfil his life’s calling with. His flesh, infused with hints of the eldritch energy coursing through him, could now be shaped to some limited extent, and thus he could take on the face of another. 

It was but a hint of the power he could wield, though he was consigned to only the weakest of the spells his sponsors had left within him so far, forcing him to conceal his true nature in this new world that was likely to condemn him.

### Meta Details

- Daniel’s core ability for this arc is [Mold Flesh]. Currently rudimentary at skin-level, but will extend to whole body at end of arc.
    - Progress with eldritch powers will increase slowly over time, but will be boosted by spreading eldritch influence
- Spreading eldritch influence means perpetrating knowledge of the eldritch, adding more eldritch beings to the world, turning natives into followers, etc. Essentially, increase the number of eldritch things in the world

    - Daniel has always prioritized his calling in life, to create wonderful stories, no matter the cost

## Chapter 2: The Curious Town of Lornridge

### Story

Wandering the town, Lornridge, it was called, Daniel immersed himself in the new world he found himself in. He observed the townsfolk’s habits and language, the traditions and culture of a people so similar yet not quite the same as the people of Earth. He took it all in, observing carefully, as a play had to be crafted to suit the environment it was released in. The town was perfect, he decided. His grand play, the likes of which this world had never seen, would unfold here in Lornridge.

After wandering the town for several days, changing faces and stealing food to survive, he finishes the outline of his play, and chooses Blackwood Manor, an abandoned and decaying structure on the town’s outskirts, as the epicenter of his grand plan, to create a cult.

### Meta Details

- The town is a large town near the sea, with a population of around 40,000 people.
    - The economy is mainly supported by the fishing industry and related businesses.
    - The technology and culture is comparable to Victorian England, although this is a less advanced rural town, compared to the capital of the Kingdom Lornridge is in.
- There is one dominant religion in the entire Kingdom of Wychmoor, known simply as the Church.
    - The church is a major power of the continent, with great influence over Wychmoor and several other nations.

- Another major power in Wychmoor is the Scholarium Magnus, a neutral institute of higher education that hosts a number of the wisest scholars and powerful mages in the continent.
    - It spans most of the nations of the continent and are a neutral party to the politics of the continent

## Chapter 3: Strange Occurrences

### Story

Within the decaying walls of Blackwood Manor, Daniel’s influence began to take hold. He etched ancient runes and sigils in the Old Script on the walls, the posts, the foundations of the manor, in the patterns of arcane formations. The old magics weakened the barrier between dimensions, allowing the realms of the Great Old Ones to seep into the world.

Strange phenomena began to emerge across Lornridge. Incomprehensible whispers echoed from old brick walls, shadows danced and distorted beneath the town’s yellow gas lamps, and windows occasionally reflected bizarre vistas instead of the mundane scenes beyond.

He began to 

## Chapter 4: Cult of the Eldritch Truth

### Story

Some of the townspeople begin noticing strange phenomena occurring around Lornridge, their souls more attuned to the eldritch enabling them to see the phenomena. Daniel wanders the town, finding these people, observing them, and chooses the most curious-minded of them to be the first actors of his play. 

Soon, strange dreams plague their nights, of the derelict manor on the edge of town, a ghostly light emanating from its windows. The fire of curiosity is lit, and they cannot help themselves as they are drawn
