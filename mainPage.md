# Prologue

Daniel Turner is a young man with a passion for crafting intricate stories and telling them through various mediums, whether it be written novels, drawn art, or sculpted virtual worlds. Unfortunately, his extreme poverty prevents him from realizing his dreams, despite his talent. 

One day, he rushes home after receiving the week’s pay check, as his luck is finally turning around, and his financial situation has begun to improve, enabling him to buy a new notebook to write with. Distracted, he’s hit by a truck, and dies.

Upon death, eldritch beings seize his soul, seeing him as a suitable herald to spread their influence to other worlds. These eldritch beings feed off of strong emotions within their sphere of influence, and believe his passion and talent for storytelling aligns with their goals. They offer him a second life and eldritch powers, in exchange for perpetuating eldritch knowledge and magic through his stories. He eagerly agrees, and is immediately struck with a blinding headache as eldritch knowledge is inserted into his mind. Amidst the pain, he is teleported to another world.
